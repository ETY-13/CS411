This is a simple implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm. All the functions are in kruskal.cpp and kruskal.hpp.
The function of use is kruskal(), which takes a multimap<int, string> that represents the weighted graph. 
The function returns a multimap<int, string> that represents the minimum spanning tree.

A simple test is provided in test.cpp, which made use of the doctest framework. 
Note that all files, including doctest.h, is required to run the test.
